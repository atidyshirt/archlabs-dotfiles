Personal dotfiles for Archcraft Linux

Here is a screenshot of my archcraft setup!

![Tiling](./previews/tiling.png)

To install, install Archcraft OS, next install the i3wm archcraft package,
lastly install my terminal configs in nvim repository, install dependencies
for terminal applications (tmux, exa, lazygit, lazydocker, neovim, ...)

Enjoy :)
